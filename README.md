# PythonAtUCSB
Notebooks from Introduction to Python

This is a new course primarily for those with little or no Python experience.

The entire course consists on the understanding of Jypter Notebooks in a 'Dialog'
style classroom so that I can see each student's work and immediately help with suggestions
and corrections
